## Sub-Heading ##
  Developers, waste no more time setting up web apps. Let Appception do all the heavy lifting for you.

## Summary ##
  With Appception, a new web app is just a few clicks away. Set up a Github Repo and a file structure in a second. Use our file editor to create your application. Finally, set up automatic deployment to show your app to the world.

## Problem & Solution ##
  Setting up a new web application project can be time consuming. Sure there are some tools that make it easier for you, like Github and Yeoman, but what if those tools were in one place? And you didn't have to use the command line to interact with them! We're making it easier for developers of any skill level to start coding in a variety of different libraries.

## Quote from You ##
  'Appception will drastically reduce the amount of overhead involved with creating a new web application.'

## How to Get Started ##
  Just log in with Github, and create a new project. A new repo will be instantiated for you, all you have to do is name it and select the type of project you'd like to make, and we'll do the rest. This lets you spend more time on the important parts, making the actual application!

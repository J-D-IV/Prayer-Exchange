# Prayer Exchange #

## What is Prayer Exchange? ##
  > Prayer exchange is an application that allows a user to send a prayer to a stranger and in exchange recieve a prayer from another sender!

## Problem ##
  > The current Bible and prayer apps are great but they tend to only focus on the indivdual using the application. Payer Exchange intends to bridge the gap between users by allowing a seemless and anonomous interaction with sending of prayers.

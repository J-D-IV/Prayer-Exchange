# Prayer Exchange #

## What is Prayer Exchange? ##
  > Prayer Exchange is an application that allows a user to send a prayer to a stranger and in exchange recieve a prayer from another sender!

## Problem ##
  > The current bible and prayer apps are great but they tend to only focus on the indivdual using the application. Prayer Exchange intends to bridge the gap between users by allowing a covid-safe, seemless, and anonymous sending of prayers.

## What We Have to Say ##

## How to Get Started ##

## Customer Quote ##
